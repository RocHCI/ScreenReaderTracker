*********** Assumption ********
* Only one upright black rectangle appeared in the image
* This assumption can be removed, if necessary.

*********** Parameters ********

Configurable in the config.xml, the default value works with provided data

brightness_thresh: definition of black (the larger this value, any pixel with brightness_thresh less than this value will be treated as black)
width_thresh: minimum rectangle width
height_thresh: minimum rectangle height
thick_thresh: maximum thickness of the rectangle (thickness means the width of each edge)
area_ratio: a value not easy to describe. valid value is 1.00 ~ 2.00. The larger this value, the higher false alarm rate is. (false alarm means there is no upright black rectangle, but this program report one)

********* How to run ****
* single run
    ./rgmRect img-filename(full path)
* check test.sh to see how to do multi-run
* $ make # to build
* add /u/yli/lib/ into LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to make it run
